# PCA Based Model Modification

## Dependencies

- python == 3.7
- pytorch == 1.12.1
- numpy == 1.21.5


## Implementation

- compute_PCA

        Calculate PCA explained variance ratio from compressed output for each activation layer
        
        Manually modify threshold for the ratio
        
        Manually adjust whether or not to print out the calculated percentage

- quantization (TBD)
